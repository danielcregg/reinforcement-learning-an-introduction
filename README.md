## Overview

Python implementations of algorithms from Sutton and Barto's *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)*. Each chapter includes runnable code that reproduces the figures and examples from the textbook.

## Features

- Complete Python implementations for all chapters (1-13)
- Reproduces key figures from the textbook
- Covers multi-armed bandits, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference learning, and policy gradient methods
- Clean, well-documented code suitable for learning and experimentation

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) package manager

## Getting Started
